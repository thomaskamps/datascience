    "The [JSON data format](http://www.json.org/) has become a popular way to interchange data. It is more concise than XML, easier for humans to read should they have to, and supported by the ECMA-405 standard. Python comes with a `json` module that operates very like the `pickle` module does. You can convert between JSON strings and Python data structures using the `json.dumps()` method that takes a Python structure argument and returns a JSON string. The converse process is performed by the `json.loads()` method,which takes a JSON string as its argument and returns the corresponding Python data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON is a useful standard for data interchange of the following (Python) types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Lists (JSON arrays)\n",
    "  * Dicts (JSON objects)\n",
    "  * Strings (JSON strings)\n",
    "  * Integers (JSON numbers)\n",
    "  * Floating-point values (JSON numbers)\n",
    "  * `True` and `False` (JSON `true` and `false`)\n",
    "  * `None` (JSON `null`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Attempts to encode other Python objects will lead to failure unless the programmer extends the JSON encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by writing a function that round-trips Python structures through the JSON notation."

    "Looking at the JSON output from `dumps()` shows you that the structure is pretty like a Python data structure made up of lists, dicts and simpler values like lists and strings. Many (but not all!) JSON data structures can be handed to the Python `eval()` function to return the same structure returned by `loads()`. It doesn't do to count on it, thoughâ€”some values are presented differently, notably `true`, `false` and `null` are the JSON equivalents of `True`, `False` and `None` respectively."
